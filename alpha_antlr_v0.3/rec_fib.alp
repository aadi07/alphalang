Define "fib" on "n" as:
    If "n"'s value is equal to 1 or "n"'s value is equal to 2:
        Return 1,
    otherwise:
        Assign the result of calling "fib" on "n"'s value - 1 to "higher",
        Assign the result of calling "fib" on "n"'s value - 2 to "lower",
        Return "higher"'s value plus "lower"'s value.

Print the result of calling "fib" on 10.
